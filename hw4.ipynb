Both articles deal with a network of film actors in which two actors are connected if they were cast in the same film.

    "Few important notes if you're interested in web scraping (if not - go on):\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can use the script if you want to increase the span of years, e.g. to 2000-2019, but it is only guaranteed to work for 2010-2019, those 10 Wikipedia pages, on 3/3/2020 (Yes, they can change!)\n",
    "* Even between 2010 and 2019 if you look closely at the script there are differences in structure\n",
    "* With great power comes great responsibility - there's ethics to web scraping, please don't bombard Wikipedia or any other site with thousands of requests, they might crash or punish you and rightly so! See e.g. [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/ethics-in-web-scraping-b96b18136f01)."
